A mock trading bot for the stock market. Being built within 3 weeks!

I've decided to use this as a learning opportunity to learn a new JS framework (Remix) and a new programming language (Rust).

## Goals

- Learn Rust
- Scrape The `StockMarketGame`'s website in order to make trades and read daily balence
- Build a better more interactive UI and send it over to the people making the game
- Have the backend also post messages to a discord channel and respond to discord slash commands
